# DeepSensor Gallery

A gallery of [DeepSensor](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/deepsensor) Jupyter notebook research demonstrators
showcasing applications of DeepSensor to real-world research problems.

* [Tom Andersson](https://github.com/tom-andersson): [Statistical downscaling of ERA5 temperature over Germany](https://github.com/tom-andersson/deepsensor_gallery/blob/main/demonstrators/andersson_era5_temperature_germany_downscaling.ipynb) (Note: this is just a preliminary example and may be removed at some point)

## :woman_student: Contributing a demonstrator
Contributions to the DeepSensor Gallery are a great way to share your research with the community and can serve as inspiration for other users.
Particularly strong examples may be added to the [main DeepSensor documentation](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/deepsensor/).

### Requirements
We want to make it as easy as possible to contribute a research demonstrator
As such, we do not enforce that contributed notebooks are fully reproducible.
For example, it is not compulsory to provide access to your data or deposit your trained model on Zenodo.
However, reproducibility is always appreciated!

For inspiration, we recommend checking out the [Environmental Data Science Book](https://edsbook.org/notebooks/gallery)
for examples of well-documented research notebook demonstrators.

### Contribution guide
To publish a notebook in the DeepSensor Gallery:
* Fork the repository
* Add your notebook to the `demonstrators/` folder in your fork
* Add your name and demonstrator's title to the list in the README.md (with links)
* Open a pull request

Depending on maintainer capacity there may be a review process.
